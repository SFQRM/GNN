While Zachary was studying the karate club, a conflict arose between the administrator and the instructor which resulted in the club splitting in two. The figure below shows the graph representation of the network and nodes are labeled according to which part of the club. The administrator and instructor are marked with ‘A’ and ‘I’, respectively.
